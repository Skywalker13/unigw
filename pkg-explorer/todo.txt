pkg-installer:
	* Add a wizard for the first run.
	* Add an advanced mode where the user is allowed to specify the architecture
	  for the platform he desires (or just default to the detected arch).
	* Prompt for a list of repository sources to add, and the root folder.
	* Init the database, and set up the sources.list.
	* ? Not sure if I want to just front-end wpkg, or link against libdebpackages.
	* Accept command line args commands:
		* is-installed
		* install
		* remove
		* update
		* upgrade
	* Throw up progress dialog (Alexis says to grep wpkg code for GET) for
	  downloads.
	* Show error dialog when lock is set (maybe even allow the lock to be deleted).
	* Show error when packages don't install right.
