[ENVIRONMENT]
The wpkg tool accept
.B $WPKG_OPTIONS
with additional options.
.PP
The libdebpackages library understands the
.B $HOME
variable for filenames that start with a tilde (~).
.PP
The libdebpackages library reads the
.B $WPKG_SUBST
variable to replace drive letters with the corresponding directory.
This is used to simulate the Microsoft DOS drive letters on any platforms.
.PP
Under MS-Windows, the libdebpackages library understands several variables
used to determine the machine being used (see wpkg --machine). Those
variables are:
.IP
.BR %PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432% ,
.br
.BR %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% ,
and
.br
.B %PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER%
.PP
The libdebpackages library and tools that need to run a batch script under
Microsoft Windows make use of the
.B %COMPSPEC%
variable as the command interpreter.
[FILES]
The wpkg tool makes use of the
.B wpkg.conf
file found in:
.IP
.B /etc/wpkg/wpkg.conf
.PP
and under your HOME directory:
.IP
.B $HOME/.config/wpkg/wpkg.conf
.PP
The libdebpackages library makes use of files saved under the specified
administration directory. The default is
.B /var/lib/wpkg
using the current letter drive under a MS-Windows operating system.
