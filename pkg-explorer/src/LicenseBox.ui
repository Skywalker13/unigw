&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family:'Courier New,courier';&quot;&gt;  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&lt;br /&gt;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&lt;br /&gt;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below,&lt;br /&gt;refers to any such program or work, and a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:&lt;br /&gt;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&lt;br /&gt;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another&lt;br /&gt;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in&lt;br /&gt;the term &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&lt;br /&gt;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&lt;br /&gt;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program&lt;br /&gt;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&lt;br /&gt;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&lt;br /&gt;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's&lt;br /&gt;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&lt;br /&gt;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&lt;br /&gt;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the&lt;br /&gt;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;&lt;br /&gt;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&lt;br /&gt;along with the Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and&lt;br /&gt;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&lt;br /&gt;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&lt;br /&gt;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&lt;br /&gt;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&lt;br /&gt;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in&lt;br /&gt;    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&lt;br /&gt;    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&lt;br /&gt;    parties under the terms of this License.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&lt;br /&gt;    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&lt;br /&gt;    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an&lt;br /&gt;    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&lt;br /&gt;    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&lt;br /&gt;    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&lt;br /&gt;    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this&lt;br /&gt;    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&lt;br /&gt;    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on&lt;br /&gt;    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&lt;br /&gt;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&lt;br /&gt;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&lt;br /&gt;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&lt;br /&gt;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&lt;br /&gt;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&lt;br /&gt;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&lt;br /&gt;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&lt;br /&gt;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&lt;br /&gt;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&lt;br /&gt;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&lt;br /&gt;collective works based on the Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program&lt;br /&gt;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of&lt;br /&gt;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&lt;br /&gt;the scope of this License.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,&lt;br /&gt;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of&lt;br /&gt;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&lt;br /&gt;    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&lt;br /&gt;    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&lt;br /&gt;    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&lt;br /&gt;    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&lt;br /&gt;    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&lt;br /&gt;    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&lt;br /&gt;    customarily used for software interchange; or,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&lt;br /&gt;    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&lt;br /&gt;    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&lt;br /&gt;    received the program in object code or executable form with such&lt;br /&gt;    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for&lt;br /&gt;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source&lt;br /&gt;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any&lt;br /&gt;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to&lt;br /&gt;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a&lt;br /&gt;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&lt;br /&gt;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&lt;br /&gt;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the&lt;br /&gt;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&lt;br /&gt;itself accompanies the executable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&lt;br /&gt;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&lt;br /&gt;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&lt;br /&gt;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not&lt;br /&gt;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&lt;br /&gt;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&lt;br /&gt;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is&lt;br /&gt;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&lt;br /&gt;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under&lt;br /&gt;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such&lt;br /&gt;parties remain in full compliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&lt;br /&gt;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&lt;br /&gt;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are&lt;br /&gt;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&lt;br /&gt;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&lt;br /&gt;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&lt;br /&gt;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&lt;br /&gt;the Program or works based on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the&lt;br /&gt;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&lt;br /&gt;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to&lt;br /&gt;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&lt;br /&gt;restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.&lt;br /&gt;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&lt;br /&gt;this License.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&lt;br /&gt;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&lt;br /&gt;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&lt;br /&gt;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&lt;br /&gt;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&lt;br /&gt;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&lt;br /&gt;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&lt;br /&gt;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&lt;br /&gt;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by&lt;br /&gt;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&lt;br /&gt;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&lt;br /&gt;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under&lt;br /&gt;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to&lt;br /&gt;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&lt;br /&gt;circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&lt;br /&gt;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&lt;br /&gt;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&lt;br /&gt;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&lt;br /&gt;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&lt;br /&gt;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&lt;br /&gt;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&lt;br /&gt;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&lt;br /&gt;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&lt;br /&gt;impose that choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&lt;br /&gt;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in&lt;br /&gt;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&lt;br /&gt;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&lt;br /&gt;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&lt;br /&gt;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among&lt;br /&gt;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&lt;br /&gt;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&lt;br /&gt;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&lt;br /&gt;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&lt;br /&gt;address new problems or concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&lt;br /&gt;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &amp;quot;any&lt;br /&gt;later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions&lt;br /&gt;either of that version or of any later version published by the Free&lt;br /&gt;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of&lt;br /&gt;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software&lt;br /&gt;Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free&lt;br /&gt;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author&lt;br /&gt;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free&lt;br /&gt;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes&lt;br /&gt;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals&lt;br /&gt;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and&lt;br /&gt;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN&lt;br /&gt;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES&lt;br /&gt;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED&lt;br /&gt;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF&lt;br /&gt;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS&lt;br /&gt;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE&lt;br /&gt;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,&lt;br /&gt;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&lt;br /&gt;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR&lt;br /&gt;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING&lt;br /&gt;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED&lt;br /&gt;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&lt;br /&gt;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER&lt;br /&gt;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE&lt;br /&gt;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
