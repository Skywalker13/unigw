	<font size="+4">A</font>t the same level as the <code>WPKG</code> directory,
	create other directories with the files you want to install. These directories
	form a structure similar to the structure used on the target machine. For
	instance, under MinGW, we install the runtime DLLs and executable under the
	directory named <code>bin</code> or <code>mingw/bin</code>. This is done by
	creating a <code>bin</code> or <code>mingw/bin</code> directory along the
	<code>WPKG</code> directory and putting the necessary dynamic libraries and
	executables in it.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Examples:<br/>
		&nbsp; <code>WPKG/control</code><br/>
		&nbsp; <code>WPKG/postinst</code><br/>
		&nbsp; <code>bin/wpkg.exe</code><br/>

	Otherwise the name is built from the name, version and architecture of the
	package (i.e. <code>wpkg_@VERSION@_win32-i386.deb</code>). Notice that the
	package is created in the current directory. Using the

<h2><a name="info">Creating packages from a .info file</a></h2>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">M</font>ost of the time, when you create a project, you will
	endup with multiple packages. For instance, you probably want to create one
	runtime package (.exe and .dll), one documentation package (.html, .info, etc.),
	one library package (.h and .a), one source package (.c, .pas, .ada, etc.).
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">B</font>ecause it is tedious to create one control file for
	each package with the correct description, version, and other common fields,
	plus create each package one by one making sure you install the right files
	in each one (and never install the same file twice), <b>wpkg</b> offers a
	way to create one <i>control</i> file and one directory tree which in
	general will help you reduce the number of errors dramatically. This
	special <i>control</i> file is the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_info.html">info file</a>.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">F</font>irst, <b>wpkg</b> checks that all the files in each package
	do not overlap. This tells you that they will be installed only once and
	that you can install all the packages without having to force <b>wpkg</b> to do
	so.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">S</font>econd, you create that single <i>control</i> file called
	the .info file. In general, you name it after your project and append the
	.info extension (i.e. <code>wpkg.info</code>). This control file includes
	definitions to let <b>wpkg</b> know how to build all the different packages for
	your project.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">P</font>lease read the description of the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_info.html">.info file</a> format for
	detailed information about it. In brief, it looks like a control file
	with extra fields. Especially, the Sub-Packages field is used to indicate
	the name of all the sub-packages to create from this .info file.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">T</font>hird, you create a WPKG (or DEBIAN) sub-directory
	in each sub-package directory if you need to include special scripts such
	as the preinst, prerm, postinst and postrm scripts. If no special scripts
	or data is necessary, you do not need to create the WPKG directory, <b>wpkg</b>
	will create it for you.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">N</font>ow you are ready to run <b>wpkg</b> to build your packages:
</p>

<pre>
	wpkg --build &lt;info file&gt; &lt;root tree&gt;
</pre>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">U</font>sing the --build command with a plain file as the
	first parameter tells <b>wpkg</b> that it is used with a .info file.
	The second parameter (which is mandatory in this case) is the path to the
	root tree including all the sub-packages data and control files.
	It is also possible to indicate the root tree path in the .info file
	using the ROOT_TREE variable.

	<font size="+4">T</font>he content of the .deb is described in the <b>control</b>
	file. The control file is a tarball composed of at least two files. <b>wpkg</b>
	supports tarballs being compressed using gzip or bzip2&mdash;however, dpkg does
	not support bzip2 compression of the control file. The corresponding extension
	must be used or the .deb will not be considered valid by <b>wpkg</b> or dpkg. The two files
	required are: control and md5sums. Without these two files, the .deb cannot
	be used for anything. The control file is a list of fields used to
	describe the package, especially its name, version and the architecture on
	which is can be installed (see the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_control.html"><b>wpkg</b> control file</a>
	for more information.) The md5sums is a list of all the files in the
	data file with their md5sum. This can be used to make sure that each file
	is correct when being installed and later to check that installed files
	have not been modified (especially before being removed, though in version
	@VERSION@ the md5sums are ignored.)
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">T</font>he <b>control</b> file can also include scripts
	to be executed as the package is being installed (<b>preinst</b> and
	<b>postinst</b>) or removed (<b>prerm</b> and <b>postrm</b>.) All these
	scripts are also executed when a package is being up- or down-graded
	(not supported in version 0.1). These scripts are
	simple shell scripts expected to run with <code>/bin/sh.exe</code>
	(your PATH needs to be properly setup since <b>wpkg</b> will only use
	sh.exe as the command and not the full path.)
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">T</font>he creation of the <b>control</b> file is done
	with the following few steps.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Create the md5sums file. This is archived using the md5sums tool.
		You need to have access to the tree of files being packaged. Use the find
		command to find all the files which need to appear in the md5sums.
		Notice that we do not include directories in the md5sums list.

<pre style="background-color: #f8f8f8;">
<span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"> 4: </span> md5sum -b &gt;md5sums `find usr -type f`
</pre>

	<li>
		Second you need to create the control file, and if necessary, the
		preinst, postinst, prerm and postrm scripts. This is not part of
		the sample script since it is expected to be a one time human
		effort that cannot be automated.
	</li>

	<p style="font-style: italic;">
		Note, however, that this process can be simplified with the use of
		default scripts that you concatenate to generate the final script.
	</p>

	<li>
		Finally, you create the control tarball with tar and compress the
		tarball. (note: if you write a script to run under MSYS, consider
		using two lines to create the tar file and one to compress it
		since the z and j options do not always work correctly under
		MSYS, especially older versions; also that way you can specify
		the compression level)
	</li>
<pre style="background-color: #f8f8f8;">
<span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"> 5: </span> tar czf control.tar.gz control md5sums preinst postinst prerm postrm

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">F</font>inally, the <b>data</b> file is the tarball
	of all the files to be installed (and removed). The tarball can be
	compressed with gzip or bzip2 and must have the corresponding
	extension to work properly. The files saved in this tarball represent
	your binaries, configuration files, locale text files, manual pages,
	themes, etc. This is usually what you get when you type the following
	commands to build your software:
</p>

<pre>
	<font color="blue">#!/bin/sh
	# if any error, stop script</font>
	set -e
	configure --prefix=/mingw
	make

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">T</font>hese files are put in a tarball with their full path
	but usually without the starting / (it is valid to use "./").
	Under the MSYS/gnuwin32 system, most user files are expected to be
	installed under /mingw. However, <b>wpkg</b> root path is /. If the
	package has files to be installed under /usr, they will instead
	be placed under /mingw (which is somewhat contrary to what
	MSYS does since MSYS considers /usr to be equivalent to /.).
	So for instance, if you create a package with a file in:
	<code>/usr/bin/my-app.exe</code>, it will be installed as:
	<code>/mingw/bin/my-app.exe</code>.
