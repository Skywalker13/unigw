	<font size="+4">O</font>ne of the most important feature, in order
	to manage many packages, is to properly name all the files coming
	along. For this reason, there is a page explaining the naming
	convention used for wpkg packages (which happens to be the same
	as the one used by debian packages.)
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">A</font>ny package filename is composed of three parts.
	Each part is separated by one underscore (_) character. The filename ends
	with the <code>.deb</code> extension.
	The three parts are the package name, its version and for binary packages,
	the architecture it was compiled for.
</p>

<pre>
	&lt;package-name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;.deb
</pre>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">U</font>sually, the <u>package-name</u> part is
	the same as the name found in the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_control.html#package">Package</a>
	field of your control file. At times, there are additional
	fields written after a minus (-) character such as
	<code>-devel</code> for a package needed only by developers.
	<!-- TODO: add all the standard extensions like -devel -->
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">W</font>hen building a package using the --build
	option and a .info file, the <u>package-name</u> is generated
	out of the concatenation of the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_control.html#package">Package</a>
	and
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_control.html#sub_packages">Sub-Package</a>
	names. For instance, a package named <code>sswf</code> with
	two sub-packages named <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code>
	would have two .deb files named <code>sswf-bin</code> and
	<code>sswf-lib</code>. Note that there are two exceptions:
	(1) if the Architecture is set to <code>source</code> then
	the Sub-Package name is not used; instead it sets the
	Architecture to <code>src</code>; (2) if the Sub-Package
	name ends with an asterisk, it is not used to mangle the
	package name.

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">S</font>ay, for instance, that you compile the z
	library twice: once with the assembly language extensions and
	once without these extensions. You can then create two packages
	named like this:
</p>

<pre>
	zlib-safe_1.2.3_win32-i386.deb
	zlib-fast_1.2.3_win32-i386.deb
</pre>

	<font size="+4">T</font>he <u>version</u> part of the package
	filename must match the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_control.html#version">Version</a>
	field in your control file exactly. For more information about
	versions, read the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_versions.html">Versions</a> page.

	part of the package filename must match the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_control.html#architecture">Architecture</a>
	field in your control file exactly. For source packages, you can
	either put <b>src</b> or nothing. The following shows two samples
	of source package filenames and one for the corresponding binary
	filename:

<pre>
