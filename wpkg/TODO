This is my TO DO list which is hardly exhaustive...

  1. create a version -> resource tool
  2. create additional cmake projects so we can get .so's
  3. fully doxygenize the libraries
  4. add support for zip files (instead of ar+tar)
  5. add support for lzma and xz formats
  6. complete tests to have better coverage
