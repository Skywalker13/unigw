<h2><a name="usys">Installing USYS</a></h2>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">A</font>t this time, USYS is just wpkg and a copy of
	the MSYS basic environment.
</p>
<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">F</font>irst you should download and install the
	wpkg tool. That will get you the tool you need to install all the
	.deb packages. Assuming that you do not have anything more than
	MS-Windows, download the following and put it in any folder:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>unzip.exe</code></li>
	<li><code>wpkg_@VERSION@_win32-i386.zip</code></li>
</ul>
<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">D</font>ecompress the wpkg tool and its documentation
	from an MS-DOS console with the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
	cd &lt;<i>path to wpkg_@VERSION@_win32-i386.zip</i>&gt;
	unzip wpkg_@VERSION@_win32-i386.zip
</pre>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">N</font>ow download the MSYS debian
	package<a class="note_link" href="#files">(1)</a> and
	put it under the newly extracted bin directory and type the
	following commands in your still open console:
</p>

<pre>
	cd bin
	wpkg --install msys_1.0.11_win32-i386.deb
</pre>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">A</font>fter this one command, you will have
	a valid USYS installation. You can now start your new Unix
	environment under MS-Windows by double clicking
	<code>msys.bat</code> in the <i>root</i> directory or on
	<code>rxvt</code> in the <i>/bin</i> directory.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">M</font>ake sure you have the right PATH
	environment variable so you can access your new tools.
	This is done with the following command inside the
	shell you just opened:
</p>

<pre>
	export PATH=/mingw/bin:/bin
</pre>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">O</font>f course, feel free to include a path to
	<code>C:\WinNT\System32</code> and other MS-Windows directories
	(but do not add some other versions of MSYS/MinGW/GnuWin32!) And
	you can always make use of your .profile or .bashrc files, but
	that may require a global HOME variable which you cannot easilly
	change (i.e. you can have only one global HOME for Cygwin, MSYS,
	USYS... but you can change it in the msys.bat to your liking and
	maybe I will have a post process to automate that at some point!)
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">F</font>rom there on, any .deb package compatible with
	USYS can be installed with the wpkg.exe tool (see
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_install.html">Installing a package</a>.)
	Note that you can install any package from anywhere, the wpkg tool assumes
	it is installed under /bin and considers / as being the root. Everything
	will always be installed under that root path (if not, that's a bug in wpkg!)
	Thus, you can be in any folder to run wpkg as long as it is in your path or
	you use the full path to the tool.
</p>

<p class="note">
	<sup><a name="files">(1)</a></sup> The following is the list of files
	present in the debian package <code>msys_1.0.11_win32-i386.deb</code>.
</p>
<pre>
	MSYS-1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe		<font color="blue">Base</font>
	MSYS-1.0.11-20060807.tar.bz2		<font color="blue">Fixes</font>
	tar-1.13.19-MSYS-2005.06.08.tar.bz2	<font color="blue">Fixes</font>

<h2><a name="why">But why USYS?</a></h2>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">A</font>t first, I would like to transform many of the
	packages I need to .deb packages. This will very much simplify their
	installation in this Unix like environment and thus help me in building
	<a class="anchor" href="http://www.m2osw.com">Made to Order Software Corporation</a>
	products.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">S</font>econd, it will be to have my own version of the
	gcc suite in order to get the library libusys.a (still to be created!)
	to auto-link with the different software I build under USYS.
	This library will offer support to ease the porting of projects to
	MS-Windows by offering the POSIX API of what is directly available
	under MS-Windows (at this time, the most problematic function is
	fork(), most others are relatively simple to implement and some
	already are available such as the pthread API from
	<a class="anchor" href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a>.)
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">F</font>or instance, USYS will transform the
	<code>fopen()</code> call in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The mode will always be forced to binary like under Linux
			(and most other Unices)</li>
	<li>If the file being opened is a (soft-)link, then the target will
			be opened instead.</li>
</ul>

<p class="par">
	Some of that functionality is currently available under MSYS, but not
	under GnuWin32. Also, MSYS makes heavy use of Cygwin source files
	and thus it cannot directly be used in a commercial project.
</p>



<h2><a name="existing">Can I use my existing MSYS/MinGW/GnuWin32?</a></h2>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">Y</font>es.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">H</font>owever, I suggest you be more careful in that
	case since you may start mixing up packages you installed with wpkg
	and packages you just uncompress in your environment. You may not be
	able to install some packages because some files already exist. And
	files which get modified cannot be removed without the --force flag
	and you could end up with packages incompatible between each others.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">T</font>his being said, for a little while, it is very
	likely that you won't be able to find a .deb for a package you need.
	In that case you will have to install it from its .zip or whatever
	other archive currently available. The problem here is: you won't
	be able to uninstall it without going through hoops.
