This is my TO DO list which is hardly exhaustive...

  1. support so wpkg can update itself (--install for upgrade)
  2. create a version -> resource tool
  3. create additional cmake projects so we can get .so's
  4. create packages for runtime, dev, doc, ... of wpkg
  5. fully doxygenize the libraries
  6. write unit tests
  7. write an exhaustive test suite of the wpkg command line
  8. add support for zip files (instead of ar+tar)
  9. add support for lzma and xz formats
