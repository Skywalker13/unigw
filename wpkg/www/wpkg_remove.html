@TITLE: Removing a package@
@UP: wpkg@
@PREVIOUS: wpkg_install@
@NEXT: wpkg_build@

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">R</font>emoving a package with wpkg is very simple. The
	following is the command to type:
</p>

<pre>	wpkg --remove <i>&lt;package-name&gt;</i></pre>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">N</font>otice that <i>&lt;package-name&gt;</i> is not the name
	of the .deb you installed, but the name of the package which was installed
	through that .deb file. In general, when a .deb package is named:
</p>
<pre>
	&lt;name&gt;-&lt;sub-project&gt;_&lt;version&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;.deb,
</pre>
<p>
	Then the package name is the &lt;name&gt;
	part without the sub-project, version or architecture (thought many
	projects now include a version number such as 2 or 3 in their name.)
	If you are not sure, you can check the name of an installed package with
	the --list command as in:
</p>

<pre>	wpkg --list</pre>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">I</font>f you still have the .deb file, then you
	can check the name with the --field, --info or --show commands.
	In case of the fields, you need to look at the field named
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_control.html#package">Package</a>
	as follow:
</p>

<pre>	wpkg --field my-package.deb Package</pre>

<table class="warning"><tbody><tr>
	<td valign="top"><span class="warn_title">WARNING:</span></td>
	<td class="warn_body">
		wpkg must be installed as <code>/mingw/bin/wpkg.exe</code> for
		this command to work properly. This is automatic when you install USYS.
