	you cannot write a version with any random character. The different

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">A</font> version is composed of one to three parts,
	the simplified syntax is:
</p>
<pre>
	[epoch:]source_version[-revision]
</pre>
<p>
	The epoch and revision numbers are optional simple decimal numbers
	([0-9]). The source version can include multiple numbers ([0-9])
	and letters ([a-zA-Z]) separated by periods (.). The following
	explains what each part is used for.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>epoch</li>
	<p>
		The epoch is one integer number ([0-9]+) assumed to start at
		zero (0) followed by a colon (:).
	</p>
	<p>
		The epoch is used when a newer version would otherwise compare
		as older in regard to any one older version of the package.
		The epoch is tested first. Within an epoch, the source_version
		much be unique and must properly identify the order of the
		packages.
	</p>
	<p>
		When is this necessary? Say you find a package with version 1.3.
		You decide to create a package for UniGW and name it 1.3. Later,
		the author of the source makes a small fix and calls the newer
		version 1.31. Again, you can create a new package and use that
		version 1.31. Some time later, the author comes up with a new
		version. This one is named 1.4. If you want to keep the author
		version (which is the usual way to do things), you still need
		to make sure that wpkg recognizes 1.4 as newer than 1.31. This
		is done with the epoch. 1.3 and 1.31 are considered as being
		0:1.3 and 0:1.31 respectively. You can therefore create a newer
		version 1:1.4.
	</p>

		<table class="warning"><tbody><tr>
			<td valign="top"><span class="warn_title">Note:</span></td>
			<td class="warn_body">
				In this case you may instead want to correct the source version
				and either use:
				<ul>
					<li>1.30 and 1.40 for main versions, or</li>
					<li>1.3.1 for the intermediate release.</li>
				</ul>
				Yet, in some cases, this can also be really confusing!
			</td>
		</tr></tbody</table>

	<p>
		It is rather rare that you will need to use the epoch, so before
		you do that, think about it.
	</p>

	<li>source_version</li>
	<p>
		This version is usually what the source tarball uses as its
		version. It is also called the upstream version.
		The source version can include digits ([0-9]), letters ([a-zA-Z])
		and periods (.). If the source package uses any other character,
		it will need to be transformed to fit this scheme.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is suggested that you should not use a source_version composed
		exclusively of zeroes (i.e. 0, 0.0, 0.0.0, etc.)
	</p>
	<p>
		wpkg, for instance, started with source version 0.1.
	</p>

	<li>revision</li>
	<p>
		The revision is an integer ([0-9]+) preceded by a minus (-). The
		default is 1 (i.e. you do not need to put -1 at the end of a version).
	</p>
	<p>
		The revision is used as the revision number of the package. It is
		assumed to start at 1 and goes up incrementally each time you
		change the control information of the package (i.e. each time
		you change something in the control file other than the version
		of the package.)
	</p>
	<p>
		It is useful each time you find a bug in your package and create
		a new package from the same source tarball. It usually is reset
		each time you change the source version (some people prefer to
		keep increasing the revision number since that represents the
		version of their package.)
	</p>
	<p>
		The revision number cannot be set to 0.
	</p>
