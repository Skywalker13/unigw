	<font size="+4">T</font>he following table describes the fields and variables
	currently understood by <b>wpkg</b>. It also includes those reserved for later
	versions of <b>wpkg</b>. The order of the fields is not important.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">Y</font>ou will find the
	<a class="anchor" href="#grammar">complete control file grammar</a>
	as supported by <b>wpkg</b> at the bottom of this page. However, there is a
	brief overview of what is supported in this file format:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Empty lines (ignored)</li>
	<li>Comments (ignored)</li>
	<li>Fields; a name followed by a colon (:) and an optional value</li>
	<li>Variables; a name followed by an equal (=) and an optional value</li>
</ul>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">L</font>ong field and variable lines are supported.
	To continue a field or a variable on the following lines, hit enter
	and put at least one space before the content. This can be done on
	any number of lines as required.

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">N</font>ot standard for debian control files,
	<b>wpkg</b> supports empty lines and comments introduced with
	the # character. If you use the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_opts.html#build">--build</a>
	command with <b>wpkg</b>, empty lines and comments will be removed
	before saving the control file in the binary package. This ensures
	better compatibility. As a side effect, the fields are saved in
	alphabetical order.

					be <code>wpkg_@VERSION@_src.deb</code>.

					The syntax of this field is a list of library names separated

					define the lower bound and the higher bound separately.

					The version comparisons are strictly equal (=), strictly earlier (&lt;&lt;),
					strictly later (&gt;&gt;), earlier or equal (&lt;=) and later or equal (&gt;=).
					By default, when no operator is specified, it is assumed that later or
					equal (&gt;=) was specified.

					<b>wpkg</b> is a required package. It is the minimum package necessary

					Some of the MSYS packages are marked important (so your configure scripts
					function) or standard (these are not required for a configure script to
					work.) Most of the gnuwin32 packages are marked optional unless they
					are used by most of the other software (i.e. gettext) in which case
					they are marked standard. Those packages that conflict with any
					others are marked extra. This means you may have to remove some other
					packages to install a given extra package.

					<a class="anchor" href="#depends">Depends</a> fields of another package as long
					as no version is specified.

					In general, it is used when two completely different projects offer exactly
					the same functionality. The most common example are two packages offering
					a mail server. The Depends field can be written like this:
<pre>
Depends: mail-server

					If the packages providing the mail server define a Provides field like this:

				the path to the root tree on the command line in which case the ROOT_TREE
				variable is ignored.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				When the variable ROOT_TREE is not an absolute path, it is taken as a local

				<code>C:\MyProject\fields.info</code> and have a <code>ROOT_TREE=packages</code>,
				then the root is expected to be: <code>C:\MyProject\packages</code>). This is

				It is part of the info file and not the control file. If it appears in a control file,

				For instance:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<code>&nbsp; Sub-Packages: runtime*, devel, doc, src</code>
				<br/>

				<code>source</code>. In that case, the Package name is used and the &lt;architecture&gt;
