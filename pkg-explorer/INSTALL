This file is part of the pkg_explorer project.

WARNING:

  This version is compatible with the wpkg 0.8.x branch only (it was
  compiled against 0.8.0 and 0.8.4 succesfully.) The wpkg_output overhaul
  in 0.9.0 prevents the compilation of this current version of pkg_explorer.

Compiling wpkg for wpkg-explorer
================================

In order to compile pkg-explorer from source, you need to first install
wpkg, either from source, or from the wpkg and wpkg-dev binary packages.
(wpkg-doc is not required for compiling.)

Please refer to wpkg in order to do that.

Note that from source, I created a script named dev/build-dist in wpkg that
may be helpful to create a distribution of wpkg. More or less, you want to
follow those instructions (update versions as required):

  tar xf wpkg_0.8.4.tar.gz
  mkdir build
  mkdir dist
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../dist ../wpkg_0.8.4
  make
  make install
  cd ..

Now you have a dist directory with wpkg 0.8.4 which is exactly what you
need to compile pkg-explorer.


Compiling wpkg-explorer
=======================

Compiling wpkg-explorer is pretty much as easy as wpkg since it makes use
of cmake. The one thing you need to define before you run cmake is the
DIST_PATH variable.

Assuming you want to work on pkg-explorer in the same directory as wpkg,
you could do this:

  tar xf pkg-explorer_0.2.4.tar.gz
  mkdir build-pe
  cd build-pe
  export DIST_PATH=dist
  cmake ../pkg-explorer_0.2.4
  make

Now you have pkg-explorer inside the bin directory, try:

  bin/pkg-explorer

Note that pkg-explorer also needs Qt4 (4.7.x or 4.8.x). The cmake script is
expected to detect Qt4 to compile and link against it. Under MS-Windows, a
pre-compiled stock version from Nokia will work as expected.


Installing the Package
======================

Feel free to run:

  make install

in order to install the pkg-explorer tool.

Note that you may want to install it in the same directory as wpkg. In that
case, make sure to define the installation directory by changing the cmake
command presented earlier with:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../dist ../pkg-explorer_0.2.4

Note that it is possible to change the prefix an any time. Just do it
before running make + make install. (You want to rerun make to make sure
that the change takes full effect before running make install.)
