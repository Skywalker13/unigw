WARNING:

  This version is compatible with the wpkg 0.8.x branch only (it was
  compiled against 0.8.0 and 0.8.4 succesfully.) The wpkg_output overhaul
  in 0.9.0 prevents the compilation of this current version of pkg_explorer.

pkg-explorer is a Qt4-based GUI utility which front-ends libdebpackages,
a source and binary package management library that allows you to
maintenance a software installation of binary packages, download updates,
install, and remove packages.

A graphical front-end really helps the user visualize the state of her package
database, plus makes it easy to maintain a list of software package sources.
This tool is a critical component to managing distributed binary software
packages, and runs on different platforms. The three supported presently are
Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows XP and over, and Mac OS/X (Darwin) 10.6+.
