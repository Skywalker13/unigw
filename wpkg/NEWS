Version 0.8

  * Got the cmake working in many cases.

Version 0.7

  * Converted the project to work with cmake

  * Completely removed the boost dependencies

  * Changed the design to load complete files in memory at once instead of
    using pipes; it makes it a lot easier to manage package archives

  * Fully implemented the --install and --remove (handles upgrades and
    configuration files); both can install/uninstall recursively

  * Includes all display functions as dpkg

  * Added an audit command line option

  * Writing documentation directly online instead of HTML in the package
    see http://windowspackager.org/

  * Corrections to the version syntax (rewritten to work like dpkg)

  * Fixed bugs in existing tools and libraries

  * Support full globbing for --list command line other other options

  * Include dot file support while creating the installation tree (i.e. you
    can ask the system to generate .dot files so you can see what your
    installation looks like)

  * Supports hundreds of verifications run before installation making it
    that much more secure

  * Includes a new tool called dar that can be used to list files from a
    Debian package (d[ebian] ar[chive]); this is a mix of ar and tar with
    compression/decompression support

  * Better organized the project folders

Version 0.6

  * Got this version to compile under Linux with boost (same as 0.5 otherwise)

Version 0.5

  * This version supports for the --build command line option with:
    . a directory tree like under Debian; or
    . a .info file and multiple directory trees.

  * I started to create a library to be able to handle Debian
    packages from any software without having to run wpkg.
