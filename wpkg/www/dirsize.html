	<font size="+4">C</font>omputing the size in bytes of all the files in a
	directory can be achieved with the Unix tool called <b>du</b>. There are
	two draw backs with that tool under MSYS/MinGW:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is part of MinGW and thus requires the MinGW library.</li>
	<li>It prints out the size <b>and</b> the name of the directory.</li>
</ul>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">T</font>herefore, I created this tool that computes the
	size exactly as required by the wpkg control files. There are two advantages:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>It computes a <i>more realistic</i> size
			<a class="note_link" href="#realistic">(1)</a>
			for the control file.</li>
	<li>It is not encumbered by the two disadvantages that <b>du</b> currently
			has.</li>
</ul>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">N</font>otice that this functionality is also available in
	wpkg in the form of a command:
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_opts.html#directory_size">--directory-size</a>.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">U</font>sage is very simple:
</p>

<pre>
	dirsize &lt;path&gt; ...
	<font color="blue"># Nearly equivalent to:  du -ks &lt;path&gt; ...</font>
</pre>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">Y</font>ou can also use the --help and --version options
	that give you a help screen and the version of the dirsize tool.
</p>

<p class="par">
	<font size="+4">S</font>ince version 0.5, this functionality was
	incorporated with the
	<a class="anchor" href="wpkg_opts.html#build">--build</a>
	and thus it probably renders this tool much less useful.
	The --build option will automatically generate the Installed-Size
	field if you don't define it yourself. (You may still need to
	define the size since what is compressed in the <code>data.tar.gz</code>
	file may only be the tip of the iceberg! Yes! Your <code>postinst</code>
	script may use the installed data files to generate other files and
	make the installation grow much larger than what is compressed
	in the <code>data.tar.gz</code> tarball.)
</p>

<p class="note">
	<sup><a name="realistic">(1)</a></sup> The size of each item is rounded up
	to 4Kb. This is what most people use under NTFS now a days, thought more and
	more, with drives of 250Gb and larger, it is becoming 16Kb. At a later time, we
	may decide to add a command line option to define this size. The size used
	by du is 512 bytes. Now, to get a more realistic usage size for the target
	system we should keep the size of each file in bytes. But that could really
	be large and probably not help that much since we still would have no clue of
	the size necessary to create the files in the first place (the space used in
	the directory structures.)
